# Alexis Pesicka - Finimize Challenge 

### How you approached the challenge
I approached this challenge first by getting and understanding of the math I needed to perform. Understanding how the calculation worked meant I could break it down into reusable parts, and then use them accordingly. Then I made it work entirely in the frontend so I knew that my understanding of the calculations was correct. Finally, I moved all the calculations into the backend and used Axios to pass the data between the frontend and backend, as this is how I am used to doing API calls. 

As I am primarily a frontend developer, the backend portion of this task took me a bit longer to wrap my head around. If I have a better understanding of how the API is desired to work and function, I can better convert my understanding to thatand adapt my workflow much more quickly. 

I spent several days learning React and getting an understanding of how Django worked so I could try and make it work. As I have no professional experience with React or Django, this meant I needed to go take a few days to be able to understand how to do things properly. I also had no experience with Chakra UI, which lead to some minor confusion, but ultimately it seems like a fun UI framework. 

### What bits of your solution you like
I enjoyed playing around with the Chakra UI framework, and if I had more time to play around with it, I would be interested to see how to better use it along side React

### What bits of your solution youâ€™d like to improve upon
* I would make it so that there was more granular control of the variables. Adding a slider for how many years someone wanted to invest, giving a breakdown of how the principal and monthly deposits look versus the growth of the investment. 

* Knowing more about the LineChart used, as well as having more experience with Chakra UI might help me to make much more reactive frontend elements. 

* Chakra UI seems like it has a lot more things to help with accessibility, but having never used it before in a professional setting, I would personally love to spend more time learning about the best way to use all the inputs it provides.  

# Finimize dev challenge

This repo is intended to be forked and uploaded to your own Github account in
order to form the submission for the challenge. Once cloned, it will give you a basic server with a React app, so you don't have to spend time writing boilerplate code. Feel free to make any changes you wish - the existing code is purely intended to get you going faster.

## Python & Django setup

* Install `python3` via brew
* Clone the repo
* cd into repo
* Install `virtualenv` using `pip3` (think yarn)

```sh
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

* Create a virtualenv for the project

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

If you're having trouble completing this step, try upgrading virtualenv first `pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv`

* Activate the virtualenv

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install dependencies in the new virtualenv

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

* Server should be running at http://localhost:8000


 ## Client setup

 * cd into `frontend` and run `yarn install`

 * Run `yarn start`. 

The webapp should now be running at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€


## The challenge

Create a web-app that shows how much you can expect to make from your savings over time.

The app must satisfy the following Acceptance Criteria (ACs):

* It should allow the user to vary the initial savings amount, monthly deposit and interest rate through the UI
* It should display how much the user's initial savings amount will be worth over the next 50 years. This should assume that the monthly amount is paid in each month, and the value rises with the interest rate supplied. There are resources online about calculating compound interest totals - e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest#Investing:_monthly_deposits)
* All calculations must take place server-side, and all monthly projection data should be returned via an endpoint
* The calculations must be triggered onChange of any input, to give live feedback on the input data. The performance (try the slider) should be reasonable.

### Our Guidance

The challenge should not take any more than 2-3 hours. You do not need to complete the challenge in one go.

These are some qualities we value:
 * Well-modularised, robust and clearly-written code
 * Maintainability. Another team member should be able to easily work with your code after you've finished.
 * Single Responsibility Principle
 * A well-organised codebase

An outline UI has been provided, as well as an example endpoint on the server. How you connect these and structure logic is up to you! Feel free to make changes to any of the code provided (including the UI) if you wish.

We have chosen to include a basic design system on the client, to give you an idea of how we like to build UIs. For this challenge we have used [Chakra JS](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started). If you're not familiar with such systems, hopefully this won't be too steep a learning curve. The docs will give you details of all the components/props you can use, but as a head-start, you can pass in styling props to the components including margins/padding etc like this:

```
// This produces a Box (styled div) with a top margin of 2, padding of 3 and a black background colour.
// Colours and spacing properties are defined in `themes/index.tsx`
<Box mt={2} p={3} bg='black'>
```

Although the API might be relatively straightforward, please try and write the API code as if you were building something more complex. We would like to gain an idea of how you would go about structuring API code.

**Once complete**, drop us a brief note (either an email, or in the readme somewhere) explaining:
* How you approached the challenge
* What bits of your solution you like
* What bits of your solution youâ€™d like to improve upon

Plese also attach an image/gif of the finished product.

### Tooling

The frontend contains some tooling you might be familiar with

#### Typescript

If you like to use Typescript in your workflow, you should get any warnings/errors appear in your terminal after running `yarn start`.

We believe strong TS typing will make your code much more robust.

#### Prettier

We believe Prettier makes your life easier! There is an example .prettierrc included in the `frontend` directory - feel free to tweak the settings if you'd prefer.

You might need to give your IDE a nudge to pick the settings up - [here's an example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58669550/4388938) of how to do that with VS Code
